# Ignition-Modbus-lab
An educational Python-based Modbus TCP simulator designed for hobbyists, automation enthusiasts, and SCADA learners aiming to explore Ignition's Modbus integration capabilities. This interactive project provides practical guidance on mapping Modbus registers presented in hexadecimal format to decimal addresses, which is essential for successful tag integration in Ignition.

The simulator, built using PySimpleGUI and pymodbus, includes dynamic data generation for motors and switchgear breakers, allowing learners to simulate realistic device behaviors, send commands, and visualize real-time data updates. Users can leverage the unlimited PySimpleGUI hobbyist license to freely experiment without limitations, making it ideal for continuous, hands-on learning.
